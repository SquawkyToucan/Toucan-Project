THOUGHT PROCESS:

Using getNeighbors, find the neighboring squares of each square, and store them in individual int[]s.
Then, eliminate all of the squares that aren't of concern.
Add the remaining lists to a larger int[]. 
Pick a random between those.

For some odd reason, Parrot only makes a move every three turns. This is probably a problem with the checking on certain moves. FALSE

No, it isn't - when I run the command "/claim" it always transitions to Parrot. TRUE

This is odd - the code on /claim works perfectly to check action to Parrot rather than screwing up and going straight to Macaw. I'm 
going to check this out and clone the code that moves /claim to Parrot rather than Macaw.
