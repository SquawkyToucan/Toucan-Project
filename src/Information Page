Information:

Players:
Parrot usually plays with moderation. They have a mix of training, claiming, and developing themselves. They traditionally win from combo.
Macaw usually plays aggresively. They train and claim more than they develop but maintain enough to keep alive. They traditionally win from conquering.
Eclectus plays peacefully. They enjoy developing more than fighting, and traditionally win from a high GDP.

Command Information:
Ending the move:
Simply don't do anything on the move, like a "skip turn."

Conceding:
Quit the game!

Attacking:
Attack another square that has been claimed by another power. Depending on
the military power that you have in comparison to theirs with a few random
tweaks, you may or may not take the square.

Training:
Training troops will boost your military power, making it more likely that you will
capture a square that you are going at. It also helps you on the defensive.

Developing:
Tech is a risky investment! You could go big and grow 5K on your GDP, or it could fail, benefiting zero. It's more likely to end up in between.
Education is a solid investment. Depending on the kids grades, you could earn between 1K and 3K.
Infrastructure always works out, but doesn't make a ton. It only gains 1K.

Play tech at the start! You can't lose that much and it's better to get off on a strong footing.
